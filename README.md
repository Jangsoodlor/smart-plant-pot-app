# Smart Plant Pot ü™¥üåä
This project aims to help users monitor the status of their plants by providing current and historical readings of soil moisture, temperature, light, and weather conditions. It also provides a prediction of soil moisture and how long it will take until the plant needs to be watered.

- For micropython code used for data collection, please refer to [knilios/SmartPlantPot](https://github.com/knilios/SmartPlantPot).
- For more information about the predicion model, please refer to [Jangsoodlor/smart-plant-pot-model](https://github.com/Jangsoodlor/smart-plant-pot-model).
